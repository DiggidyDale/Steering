## Evolutionary Steering

This is an example of an evolutionary computation.

In this boids randomly move, lose health over time and are randomly attracted/replused by food/poison.

When they 'eat' poison they lose health and when they 'eat' food they gain health. Randomly a boid may reproduce and pass on its attraction/replusion with a chance of a slight mutation.

The idea of this came from Daniel Shiffman's nature of code.
